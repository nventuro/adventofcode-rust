# Advent of Code - Rust

Rust solutions for the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) puzzles.

I had not written much Rust before attempting these and am using them as a learning exercise, so they should not be taken as the best (or even good) way of tackling these problems.

### [Day 1 - Fuel Calculations](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-01)

Basic project setup with simple input file parsing and tests.

### [Day 2 - Simple Computer](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-02)

Computer with indexed-mode 'add' and 'multiply' instructions.

### [Day 3 - Crossed Wires](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-03)

Look for intersections of 2D lines. Bigger data structures, nested loops.

### [Day 4 - Password Guessing](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-04)

Simple Finite State Machine, light string manipulation.

### [Day 5 - Complex Computer](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-05)

Improve Day 2 computer by adding generic IO, comparisons and jumps.

### [Day 6 - Orbital Analysis](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-06)


### [Day 7 - Series Amplifiers](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-07)

Use multiple Day 5 computers in threads, with their IO being connected accross threads.

### [Day 8 - Image Decoding](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-08)

Decode and print a binary image. Usage of iterators, `chucks_exact`, `min_by_key`, among others.

### [Day 9 - Complete Computer](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-09)

Finish Day 5 computer adding relative loading, 'infinute' memory (hash table based) and larger data types.

### [Day 10 - Asteroid Monitoring Station](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-10)

N^2 algorithms detecting asteroids blocked by line of sight.

### [Day 11 - Painting Robot](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-11)

Improve computer IO: create robot with sensors and motors that moves around.

### [Day 12 - N-Body Problem](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-12)

Nested arrays, intensive use of iterators, map and fold.

### [Day 13 - Brickbreaker Game](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-13)

Use computer with improved IO to automatically play a brickbreaker game. Usage of `termion` to handle console.

### [Day 15 - Robot Maze](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-15)

Use computer to map maze using BFS. Lots of iterators, vectors and enums.
