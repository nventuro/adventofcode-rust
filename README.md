# Advent of Code - Rust

Rust solutions for the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) puzzles.

I had not written much Rust before attempting these and am using them as a learning exercise, so they should not be taken as the best (or even good) way of tackling these problems.

### [Day 1 - Fuel Calculations](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-01)

Basic project setup with simple input file parsing and tests.

### [Day 2 - Simple Computer](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-02)

Computer with indexed-mode 'add' and 'multiply' instructions.

### [Day 3 - Crossed Wires](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-03)

Look for intersections of 2D lines. Bigger data structures, nested loops.

### [Day 4 - Password Guessing](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-04)

Simple Finite State Machine, light string manipulation.

### [Day 5 - Complex Computer](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-05)

Improve Day 2 computer by adding generic IO, comparisons and jumps.

### [Day 6 - Orbital Analysis](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-06)


### [Day 7 - Series Amplifiers](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-07)

Use multiple Day 5 computers in threads, with their IO being connected accross threads.

### [Day 8 - Image Decoding](https://github.com/nventuro/adventofcode-rust/tree/master/day-08)

Decode and print a binary image. Usage of iterators, `chucks_exact`, `min_by_key`, among others.
